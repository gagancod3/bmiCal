      <h3>BMR</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while
        resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is
        inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car
        consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to
        maintain vital organs, which include the heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous
        system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin. For
        most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each day
        is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and
        ~10% is used for the digestion of food, also known thermogenesis.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The BMR is measured under very restrictive circumstances while awake. An
        accurate BMR measurement requires that a person's sympathetic nervous
        system is inactive, which means the person must be completely rested.
        Basal metabolism is usually the largest component of a person's total
        caloric needs. The daily caloric need is the BMR value multiplied by a
        factor with a value between 1.2 and 1.9, depending on activity level.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In most situations, the BMR is estimated with equations summarized from
        statistical data. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest
        equations introduced. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate and was
        used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced.
        The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation has been shown to be more accurate than the
        revised Harris-Benedict Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly
        different in that it calculates resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE),
        which takes lean body mass into account, something that neither the
        Mifflin-St Jeor nor the Harris-Benedict Equation do. Of these equations,
        the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation
        for calculating BMR with the exception that the Katch-McArdle Formula
        can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know their body fat
        percentage. You can pick the equation to be used in the calculation by
        expand the settings.

      <h3>BMR Variables</h3>
      <h3>Muscle Mass</h3>
      <p>
        Aerobic exercise such as running or cycling has no effect on BMR.
        However, anaerobic exercise, such as weight-lifting, indirectly leads to
        a higher BMR because it builds muscle mass, increasing resting energy
        consumption. The more muscle mass in the physical composition of an
        individual, the higher the BMR required to sustain their body at a
        certain level.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Age</h3>
      <p>
        The more elderly and limber an individual, the lower their BMR, or the
        lower the minimum caloric intake required to sustain the functioning of
        their organs at a certain level.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Genetics</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Hereditary traits passed down from ancestors influence BMR.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Body Frame Size</h3>
      <p>
        Cold environments raise BMR because of the energy required to create a
        homeostatic body temperature. Likewise, too much external heat can raise
        BMR as the body expends energy to cool off internal organs. BMR
        increases approximately 7% for every increase of 1.36 degrees Fahrenheit
        in the body's internal temperature.
