      <h3>Body Fat</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The scientific term for body fat is "adipose tissue." Adipose tissue
        serves a number of important functions. Its primary purpose is to store
        lipids from which the body creates energy. In addition, it secretes a
        number of important hormones, and provides the body with some cushioning
        as well as insulation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat. Essential
        body fat is a base level of fat that is found in most parts of the body.
        It is necessary fat that maintains life and reproductive functions. The
        amount of essential fat differs between men and women, and is typically
        around 2-5% in men, and 10-13% in women. The healthy range of body fat
        for men is typically defined as 8-19%, while the healthy range for women
        is 21-33%. While having excess body fat can have many detrimental
        effects on a person's health, insufficient body fat can have negative
        health effects of its own, and maintaining a body fat percentage below,
        or even at the essential body fat percentage range is a topic that
        should be discussed with a medical professional.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Storage fat is fat that accumulates in adipose tissue, be it
        subcutaneous fat (deep under the dermis and wrapped around vital organs)
        or visceral fat (fat located inside the abdominal cavity, between
        organs), and references to body fat typically refer to this type of fat.
        While some storage fat is ideal, excess amounts of storage fat can have
        serious negative health implications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Excess body fat leads to the condition of being overweight and
        eventually to obesity given that insufficient measures are taken to curb
        increasing body fat. Note that being overweight does not necessarily
        indicate an excess of body fat. A person's body weight is comprised of
        multiple factors including (but not limited to) body fat, muscle, bone
        density, and water content. Thus, highly muscular people are often
        classified as overweight.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The rate at which body fat accumulates is different from person to
        person and is dependent on many factors including genetic factors as
        well as behavioral factors such as lack of exercise and excessive food
        intake. Due to varying factors, it can be more difficult for certain
        people to reduce body fat stored in the abdominal region. However,
        managing diet and exercise has been shown to reduce stored fat. Note
        that both women and men store body fat differently and that this can
        change over time. After the age of 40 (or after menopause in some cases
        for women), reduced sexual hormones can lead to excess body fat around
        the stomach in men, or around the buttocks and thighs of women.

      <h3>Potential Complications of Excess Body Fat</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies obesity as one of the
        leading preventable causes of death worldwide that is estimated to claim
        111,909 to 365,000 deaths per year in the U.S. This has been a growing
        cause for concern because 36.5% of U.S. adults are defined as obese
        according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Obesity is associated with a reduction in quality of life, poorer mental
        health outcomes, obstructive sleep apnea, as well as multiple leading
        causes of death worldwide such as cardiovascular disease, stroke,
        certain cancers and diabetes.2 All of these potential complications have
        the ability to reduce a person's life expectancy, and as such, obesity
        is a medical condition that is studied by many researchers.
      </p>

        As previously mentioned, fat produces a number of essential hormones
        that affect a person's body. An excess or a lack of critical hormones
        can have negative effects that preclude proper body function. On a
        related note, studies have found that excess body fat, particularly
        abdominal fat, disrupts the normal balance and function of some of these
        hormones. Furthermore, body fat, specifically visceral fat, has a role
        in the release of specific cytokines, which are a broad category of
        proteins involved in cell signaling, that can potentially increase the
        risk of cardiovascular disease. Visceral fat is also directly associated
        with higher levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, lower
        high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and insulin resistance.3 LDL
        cholesterol is commonly referred to as "bad cholesterol" while HDL is
        referred to as "good cholesterol." High levels of LDL cholesterol can
        clog arteries and lead to complications including heart attacks. Insulin
        resistance involves cells not properly responding to the hormone
        insulin, which can lead to high blood sugar levels, and eventually to
        type 2 diabetes. As can be seen, excess visceral fat can have measurable
        negative impacts to a person's health.
