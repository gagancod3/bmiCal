      <h3>Body Mass Index</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height
        of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of
        the body height, and is universally expressed in units of
        <samp class="units"> kg/m<sup>2</sup></samp
        >, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value
        and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration. Use
        the "Metric Units" tab for the International System of Units or the "Other
        Units" tab to convert units into either US or metric units. Note that the
        calculator also computes the Pond Index in addition to BMI, both of which
        are discussed below in detail.

      <h3>BMI introduction</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their
        height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely
        used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight
        for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of
        BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight,
        overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between.
        These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are
        sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight
        or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have
        significant health effects,so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy
        body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or
        action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different
        categories based on BMI that is used by the calculator.
